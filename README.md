# Nonlinear-ID-EDMD-and-NMPC-of-the-Lorenz-System
In this task, the dynamics of the Lorenz system is identified with EDMDc (Extended Mode Decomposition with Control) and the identified model is used for NMPC control to track references.
You can change ID_type to swith to continous/discrete system identification. You may also change the candidate functions in Candidate_Library.m to identify your own system. 
You may also change linear/nonlinear constraints to fit your needs in NMPC framework.
